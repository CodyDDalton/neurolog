## Project and Portfolio Proposal Details

This document contains general notes related to...

<br>

## Project Workflow
Brief overview of research. 

* 1 - I learned more about branches, and subsequently created the docs, research, portfolio-demo, stage, and dev branches. 

* 2 - I also learned about the flow of pushes and pulls in relation to level of completion. When something is ready to move on from the docs, research, or portfolio-demo branches, they will be merged into dev. And then when ready to move on from dev, onto stage. And finally, eventually, from stage to main.

* 3 - Lastly, I learned more about the utility of the Github project board. It's really helpful to go on and be able to see what's in progress, what's completed, and what's still left to do.

## Researching Best Fit for Tech Stack
Brief overview of research. 

* 1 - I went searching to see if something like MongoDB could be used effectively for storing journal posts, and it appears that Mongo can handle 'large objects' and files of quite some size just fine.

* 2 - I researched a few different front-end frameworks but ended up deciding to stick with React. Part of the reason being that I think React will do a fine job for what I intend to use it for, but the other part is that I'm more comfortable with React and would rather learn to further master React than to be mediocre at something else.

* 3 - Node and Express should work fine for the server side. I also decided that I'll be using bcrypt for passwords and post encryption. It does the job well and I have a decent amount of experience using it.

## Market and Mental Health Research
Brief overview of research. 

* 1 - I found a litany of research concerning the mental health crisis going on in the world. Not only are the numbers increasing, but the government expenditure to address the issue is failing to increase alongside. It's not hard to see why so many people I know are using mental health applications to help manage their symptoms and get some relief.

* 2 - The numbers back up my assertion that a lot of people are using mental health applications. I knew I'd seen them often advertized and I knew from personal experience that people I knew were using them, but seeing the market numbers in the billions of dollars was something I didn't quite expect to see.

* 3 - I investigated Waffle Journal to understand one of my potential competitors, and I also further investigated an app I use myself called Finch. I really think both are good apps, but they both fall short of offering what I'd like for NeuroLog to provide.

World Health Organization. (2023). Mental health. World Health Organization. https://www.who.int/health-topics/mental-health#tab=tab_2

*I learned that the rate of mental illness issues increased 13% over ten years, from 2007 to 2017. I also learned that 20% of adolescents worldwide have been diagnosed with a mental illness, and yet the average government expenditure toward this rising issue is estimated at less than 2% of the average budget.*

*I learned that during the coronavirus crisis, nearly half of all Americans reported recently suffering from negative mental health symptoms, and 10% felt that their mental health needs were not being met.*

Mental Health Apps Market Size Report, 2022-2030. (n.d.). www.grandviewresearch.com. https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/mental-health-apps-market-report

*I learned about the massive 5.2 billion USD market for mental health applications, as reported by Grand View Research - and that there is an expected 15.9% annual rate of growth for mental health applications from 2023 to 2030*

Personal Development Market Size Report, 2020-2027. (n.d.). www.grandviewresearch.com. https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/personal-development-market

*I learned that the personal development app market is perhaps even larger, or more expensive, than the mental health app market at an estimated 41 billion USD and a 5.5% rate of compound annual growth. Definitely a potential secondary market.*

CDC. (2021). Youth Risk Behavior Survey. https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/pdf/YRBS_Data-Summary-Trends_Report2023_508.pdf

*I learned that in 2021, more than 4 in 10 (42%) students felt persistently sad or hopeless and nearly one-third (29%) experienced poor mental health. That's staggering... And very sad. But also good data to use to point to the need for apps like NeuroLog.*

Bryant, J., & Welding, L. (2023, February 15). College Student Mental Health Statistics | BestColleges. Www.bestcolleges.com. https://www.bestcolleges.com/research/college-student-mental-health-statistics/

*Likewise, I learned that in 2022, over three-quarters of college students (77%) experienced moderate to serious psychological distress - with 35% diagnosed with anxiety and 27% with depression. This doesn't surprise me as much, college is stressful.*

Mental Health America. (2023). The State of Mental Health in America. Mhanational.org; Mental Health America. https://mhanational.org/issues/state-mental-health-america

*I learned that more than half of all people in the US with a mental illness were not getting the treatment they needed, as of 2023. That's depressing in its own right, but with what I've seen in my own experience and those of my family members, I'm not all too surprised.*

National Alliance on Mental Illness. (2023, April). Mental health by the numbers. NAMI; National Alliance on Mental Illness. https://www.nami.org/mhstats

*I learned a lot of useful statistics related to U.S. mental health statistics, including a statistic regarding the amount of people living in areas with a low amount of mental health resources. In my recent experience, where I live there are just a handful of psychiatrists and so the waiting times are long and torturous.*
