## The Principles of Project Management
Brief overview of research. 

* 1 - It's worth noting that not all projects are worth pursuing. It's important to evaluate the potential project before beginning in order to choose a project which has the best opportunities among other options.

* 2 - Some important notes on traits of good projects: they promise big benefits, with defined metrics to support those benefits; they're important to the future of the organization/individual/mission; there is a sufficient amount of resources invested in them; and they have other supporters - such as others within the organization. 

* 3 - You have to consider the project from a multitude of angles, including those involved at different levels. This includes stakeholders, team members, project overseers, and the potential users/customers/buyers. Caught too much in any one of these points of view and you risk ostrasizing and failing to meet the needs of one of these important groups.

## Software Development Discovery Process
Brief overview of research. 

* 1 - There are a lot of questions one can ask in the discovery process in order to help give shape to the ongoing project to come. These questions can help to frame the evantual application's impact, measure its eventual success, and guide design and IT implementations.

* 2 - One of the obstacles to an application being finished and finding success can be the decision paralysis at the start of the project; where there is so much to do and so much to be decided that it feels overwhelming and it's hard to figure out where to start. By asking the questions as mentioned in the point above, we can start to give shape to the project through a series of small decisions.

* 3 - It's super important to have a strategy for the ongoing project well before it even begins. Without knowing the way you want the user to experience it, the kind of impact you want it to have, and the ways in which you want it to develop and be deployed, you are steering a powerful ship aimlessly and you risk wasting time, money, and good opportunities. By planning ahead and making those important decisions in discovery, the path is charted - which is at least half the journey.

## How to Evaluate Startup Ideas
Brief overview of research. 

* 1 - You have to beware of Solutions in Search of a Problem. That means beginning from the idea of using a particular technology to solve a particular problem, but not initially having a problem present. Sometimes this results in the laborious creation of a brilliant solution... to a problem that no one is having - and thus, it not actually being used. Instead, you should begin with the concept of a problem to solve and then work backwards to discover a way that problem might be solved. This way, you're making sure that whatever you succeed in creating, it will actually address a truly existing problem - and the solution will actually be made use of.

* 2 - Always, always, always research your idea before deciding to delve into it and sink time, energy, money, and other resources into it. This is for two major reasons. Number one, there may already exist a version of the idea you have and it may already be operational, well-known, and good at what it does. You may or may not have good ideas on how to improve on the concept, but if you are aware of pre-existing applications of the same idea then it is worth studying and figuring out how they did it and why they made the choices they made before delving into it further. Secondly, there may be practical reasons as to why an idea hasn't been actualized yet, and knowing of these can help inform you on the obstacles ahead.

* 3 - Don't wait around for just the perfect idea for development. Likewise, don't choose the very first idea that pops into your mind. In the latter case, many times you may not have actually considered whether or not it would make a good idea or would be useful. In the former case, you may watch as good ideas pass you by and get picked up and developed by other people more willing to take the chance. Find a middle ground area. Is it a decent enough idea? Is it interesting? Then, consider giving it a shot. Evaluate it realistically, but not pessimistically.

**Resource 1: The Principles of Project Management**  
The Principles of Project Management
https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-principles-of/9780980285864/Text/ch02.html 

I learned about some important factors that play into the process of choosing, beginning, and working on projects. This included the fact that not all projects are to be treated as equal, and there are in fact better or worse projects to choose from. When choosing, it's important to take note of the opportunities presented by each option and choose the best among the lot. There are other important traits denoting good projects as well, including the promise of measurably big benefits, importance to the group working on it, sufficient resources to devote to it, and the existence of outside supporters to help it succeed.

I also learned the importance of viewing a project from many angles, including those of the stakeholders, the team members, the overseers, and the end users. You can't just work on a project from any one of these viewpoints of else you miss integral aspects of what will help it to flourish.

**Resource 2: Software Key Kickoff Questions**    
Discovery: Can You Answer Softwareâ€™s Key Kickoff Questions? 
https://envylabs.com/insights/software-development-discovery-process/ 

The discovery process is integral to the success of any projects. This article was really helpful in identifying and explaining a multitude of helpful kickoff questions to guide discovery and give shape to the project in its early stages. It emphasises the importance of forming a strategy ahead of time to make the project more likely to result in success - which is to say, the project ends up being impactful, well-designed, and well-executed. Without doing so, you risk the opposite. Really, the first big obstacle to making progress on the project can be the decision paralysis of having so much to decide and so much to do. 

These kickoff questions are great as guiding principles for asking the important questions. With the questions, it is easier to come up with the answers. And with the answers, the shape of the project becomes more clear.

I learned that it is best to begin from the standpoint of a problem you wish to solve rather than a solution you wish to implement. By focusing only on the idea of a solution, you may not consider whether or not the idea is actually something that people need or will actually be interested in using. That doesn't mean, of course, bypassing any idea that you're uncertain of. It means doing an adequate amount of research. Is the idea something that already exists? Is the idea something that doesn't exist because there is a major obstacle you may not be able to surmount? 

Even if there are obstacles, that doesn't mean you need to let the idea pass you by and be overly pessimistic. It's important to be realistic, but to still not be overly averse to risk and difficulty. If anyone could do it, it would exist already. Yet, you can't expect to be a miracle worker.
