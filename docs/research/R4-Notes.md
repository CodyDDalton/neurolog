## Front-End Development
Brief overview of research. 

* 1 - I learned a few tips and tricks to add to what I learned last week regarding thinking of React in terms of atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages. The article I read this week phrased it a bit differently and explained it with different terms, but ultimately the principles were similar regarding seeing the page as a whole and on the small scale. This time, there was discussion regarding states and so forth, which was relevant to my work this week and helped provide a refresher on things like the useState hook.

* 2 - I learned about proptypes and how to use them in your work to essentially throw errors when the wrong kind of data comes through. I don't know if this is something I'd actually have to worry about with my application, but it can't hurt to implement it all the same. There's a good chance that I'm not seeing the full picture just yet regarding its use.

* 3 - ESLint is an extension I've been using for months on my projects and I find it to be really helpful. The article I read goes into detail about all the ways that ESLint can help you keep your code clean - some I was previously aware of and some that I am glad to have been exposed to. All things considered, I wasn't especially happy with the fact that to read the article I had to create an account. I get enough spam as it is. Regardless, there were a few gems here and there.

Use this section to highlight your own independent research. Replace the example references below with your own links and recommended resources. For example...

(1) Thinking in React â€“ React. (n.d.). React.dev. https://react.dev/learn/thinking-in-react

*Expanded my understanding of States and also furthered my education in thinking of the big and small picture in regards to web design using React.*

(2) Niedringhaus, P. (2019, February 19). How ESLint Makes Me a Better React Developer. Medium. https://itnext.io/how-eslint-makes-me-a-better-react-developer-237fb14c00ae

*I've been using ESLint for a good while, so a good bit of this was rehash. Even still, there were a few good reminders of ways it helps that I don't often consider.*

(3) prop-types. (n.d.). Npm. https://www.npmjs.com/package/prop-types

*I really wasn't too aware of what prop types were and how to make use of them. I can certainly see the utility, especially in situations where you want to make extra certain that the data coming in is of a type that makes sense for what you're using it for.*
