## Wireframes and Structure
Brief overview of research. 

* 1 - I learned more about the inherent purpose of wireframes and how they differ from more in-depth design. In the past, I've had the habit of doing it all at once; and often I end up changing my mind - and design - later on. This time, I really see the value in starting with a bare architecture and then going into more detail thereafter. In a way, I feel like it provides more time to get creative, once the bare bones are established and the overall purpose of each component is known.

* 2 - I learned that it is wise to start with the mobile wireframe before thinking about larger screens. For NeuroLog, I want it to be something people can use on their phones but also on a tablet device. Starting with the smaller screen and having to think about what will and won't fit, and what is and is not wholly necessary, helps to create a more streamlined and organized design that will scale well to larger screens thereafter.

* 3 - I learned about some key questions to ask yourself while you're designing your wireframe. Those questions, taken from source #3 below, are: How can you organise the content to support your users’ goals? Which information should be most prominent? Where should your main message go? What should the user see first when arriving at the page? What will the user expect to see on certain areas of the page? Which buttons or touch points does the user need to complete the desired actions?*

## Style & Brand
Brief overview of research. 

* 1 - I learned about choosing fonts based upon the kind of traits you want to be associated with your brand. The three adjectives I chose were calm, playful, and inviting. Since I went with a robot mascot that was expressive, I wanted some combination of robotic formal and playfully friendly. Ended up going with Roboto Slab for the serif font (using for titles and headings) and Ubuntu for a sans serif font (used for everything else).

* 2 - I learned a bit about color theory for websites and the overall psychology of color. There's a good bit about this that I had some sense of previously, but it was a good refresher. What really stood out that I want to keep in mind is the tips on where to use certain colors.

    Primary color: This is where the user’s attention goes. Calls-to-action, buttons, and any other important information should utilize the primary color.
    Secondary color: The secondary colors are used to highlight less important elements. Secondary action buttons, less important text, and anything else that doesn’t need immediate attention should be presented in a secondary color.
    Neutral/Additional colors: Neutrals are typically used for text, backgrounds, or anything else that does not need to compete for attention.*
*For the color scheme overall I'm looking at blues and turkoise colors of a range of hues.*

* 3 - I learned about making good use of background images for texture. I was thinking that I'd love to use a background texture of some kind that maybe evoked the sciency feel of keeping a lot, running statistics, and so forth. I was thinking it might be neat to do something related to particles for a bit of a subtle rougher look behind the rest.*

*I learned that it's really important to actually go through the wireframing process on its own, rather than to try to lump it together with the other aspects of design. In a way, starting with the understanding of what each part needs to achieve and giving oneself time to sit on that before choosing font, color, and other design details... is likely to result in a much more purposeful and intentional design.*

(2) The Segue Creative Team. (2016, May 13). The Importance of Wireframing for a Responsive Website. Segue Technologies. https://www.seguetech.com/the-importance-of-wireframing-for-a-responsive-website/

*I learned about the general process of creating an effective wireframe, notably that you should start from a smaller screen and work your way up in order to get a sense of what is most necessary and integral to the design of the website or application. I want NeuroLog to be something people can access and use on their phones, but also on their tablets. Starting from the phone view first will probably help make sure everything is well organized and not overly cluttered on both devices. I also learned that it's apparently pretty common to start with a rough sketch on a pad of paper, which is a relief for me - as that's what I tend to do to get started designing.*

(3) The Definitive Guide: How To Create Your First Wireframe. (2019). Careerfoundry.com. https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/how-to-create-your-first-wireframe/

*I gathered a really helpful set of questions to get me started thinking about the overall design of NeuroLog's wireframe. How can you organise the content to support your users’ goals?*

    Which information should be most prominent? Where should your main message go? What should the user see first when arriving at the page?
    What will the user expect to see on certain areas of the page?
    Which buttons or touch points does the user need to complete the desired actions?

(4) Nediger, M. (2019, April 23). Everything You Need to Know About Picking Brand Fonts. Venngage. https://venngage.com/blog/brand-fonts/

*I learned some key information about choosing fonts. In the past, I more or less went with fonts that I thought looked nice, but often I didn't really consider how they worked with the rest of the design I was trying to present. I found it really helpful to start thinking about the impression I want the user to get and then go font finding from there.*

(5) Website color schemes: Theory, practice, and inspiration. (n.d.). WP Engine. https://wpengine.com/resources/website-color-schemes/

*Before starting my research further into color theory and the psychology of color for websites, I had strongly considered using blue. Now, after reading, I am even more set on using a variety of blue hues as well as some that might be more in line with turkoise. Along with some blue-grays and near-white blues. I have also taken notes regarding where to use the primary, secondary, and neutral colors most effectively in my design.*

*As much as I love the designs I've put together, I knew something was a little bit missing. Reading this article and seeing some of the examples helped me to realize that my design needed texture. So, for the background I'm going to use a kind of dynamic repeating design to add some texture!*
