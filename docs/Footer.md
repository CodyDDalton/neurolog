## Proposed Changes to Original Scope

Originally, I thought to have functionality to analyze repeated words and key terms for analysis. Not only is this a tall order for me - and would probably require languages and technologies beyond scope - but I think the same can be accomplished through responsive interactions. Rather than the user posting and getting passive feedback via analysis feedback alone, I propose that the interface ask questions based upon the logs and mood trends, gathering information more overtly and making it feel more like Astrid is communicating with the user rather than analyzing them from a distance. 

As an example for how that would look, say someone checked in on Neurolog and clicked on a frowny-faced emoji as their current moodlet. And maybe they also said they hadn't eaten in a while. Astrid could then respond with encouragement to have a bite to eat, and ask them how they're doing today and what is bothering them. This prompts the user to correspond with the app in a more open and comforting manner than posting and receiving passive feedback only viewable in charts and statistical figures.
