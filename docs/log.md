## üì¢ &nbsp; Weekly Stand Up

Each week I will summarize my milestone activity and progress by writing a stand-up. A stand-up is meant to be a succinct update on how things are going. Use these prompts as a guide on what to write about:

‚öôÔ∏è Overview - What I worked on this past week
<br>
üåµ Challenges - What problems did I have & how I'm addressing them
<br>
üèÜ Accomplishments - What is something I "leveled up" on this week
<br>
üîÆ Next Steps - What I plan to prioritize and do next

<br>

### Week 1

This past week I conducted a lot of research; firstly, regarding project workflow using the provided materials in the 1.3. Research 1 - Workflow lesson; secondly, regarding the tech stack I will be using to actualize this project - I settled on MERN; thirdly, regarding mental health (the topic that influences NeuroLog's design most) and market research for mental health applications and personal development applications.

I also filled out my research notes, TechStack.md, and ProjectProposal.md. I am also filling out log.md as I type these words. As I completed each part of my work, I updated my project issues - moving them from to-do, to in progress, and finally to done. As the issues were completed, my milestone 1 progress was measured. At the end, I updated the details for my Milestone 1.

My primary challenge this week was finding the time to get things done, as I - perhaps ironically and perhaps fittingly - had to handle a significant mental health crisis in my very close family. It has been an exhausting week. Otherwise, the most difficult challenge was acquiring research that I felt best suited what I needed to show for my proposal. Short of finding data indicating that mental health app users want more details and less fluff in their apps, I think I found most of what I expected to find regarding the overall need and market for NeuroLog to make sense as a product.

While I didn't do perfectly, I feel that I leveled up on my use of git - properly creating and deleting branches, navigating them easily, posting regular commits... Certainly better than my past work!

Next I expect to get started on the wireframes and get a stronger sense of how the app will look visually. I'm excited to make some decisions regarding color and placement of elements.

### Week 2

This week I started out by working on my wireframes. First came the research, but I learned about their importance as well as how to create effective monochromatic 'blueprints' to demonstrate the basic structure the app will take on. I created basic wireframes for both mobile and tablet views, and then created four mobile views to demonstrate app functionalities; posting an entry, posting a log, posting a prompt entry, and viewing user metrics and stats. I incorporated a mascot designed by my fiancee, who we are calling Astrid the Companion Droid. Later, I researched branding and style - coming to my own conclusions about the colors and fonts I wanted to use; which I then implemented into the NeuroLog style tile.

My biggest challenge initially was deciding on colors. I wanted something that felt comforting, inviting, and playful - but I also wanted it to look professional and minimalist. That was a hard balance for me to find at first, though I did end up with what I think is a smart looking scheme.

I continued to do my best to improve my git skills. In addition, I feel like I really leveled up my design skills on Figma. I really had a ton of fun and yet also ended up with a result that I was proud of.

Next, I think that I'll get working on undestanding prototyping and UX - maybe getting some new ideas, or otherwise better understanding my current ones.

### Week 3

This week, I began by doing research into design theory as well as production planning. Two areas I felt I learned the most related to 1. good tips for making your own API - including using the right status codes, good error messages, sticking to nouns instead of verbs for urls, and using parameters for searches. 2. atomic design, looking at design from the microscopic level up to the macroscopic level, including atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages. I then went onto Figma and created a flow from page to page for demonstrative purposes - and it really made the app feel a lot more alive! I also implemented click flows for the social media icons, opening new windows for Facebook, Pinterest, and Twitter. Lastly, I planned out my project in terms of the components, models, states, and routes that I would need to create for NeuroLog to function and look the way I intend. It was a long process for me, but also an illuminating one. The project feels more concrete in my mind than before. I then, of course, updated my issues and milestone, and performed the necessary pull requests and merges.

The toughest challenge this week was certainly sitting down and detailing each component, and thinking through the models, states, and routes I would need to implement. In past projects, I created these things as they were needed. It's an entirely different skill to prepare and plan ahead.

I think that was also the big thing I leveled up in this week. My planning and the way I think about projects. Before, I admittedly did a lot of flying by the seat of my pants. Sometimes to great results and sometimes otherwise. But, in putting in the time and effort to plan it all out, I get a much more in-depth and detailed sense of the project and what I needed to do to get it finished.

I expect a lot of next week will involve me beginning to create the parts and pieces that I've created issues for.

### Week 4

This week involved a lot of working on coding. Which I was excited for. Though I have to admit, it was a lot to try to get done. I didn't allot myself as much time as I should have to get all the work done at a reasonable tempo. Regardless, I was able to create a strong preview of what NeuroLog is going to look like in the future. I completed all the major components, including the header, footer, user file, quick logs file, and user welcome. I also created components I wasn't expecting to initially, including entries, logs, prompts, and stats.

The biggest challenge this week was just getting everything as done as possible in the timeframe I had to work with. There were no major obstacles surprisingly, and I was actually quite proud of how swiftly I was able to implement things I've learned over the months to create the kind of functionality I wanted to see. Albeit mostly mock functionality for now.

I think I really leveled up this week on coding in general. I'm not perfect by any means, but I really noticed how much easier it was for me to turn a concept into a reality with my understanding of React. I needed surprisingly little Google research to augment my knowledge, which is a pretty big deal for me. It had me feeling 'fluent' in React, to some degree. And that was a nice feeling.

Going forward from here, I will be implementing the true functionality of the app with a server and a database. I will also be looking to do some refactoring where I can as well, because I'm sure that trying to get things made in a short span of time had me coding in ways that might smell a bit funky here and there.
