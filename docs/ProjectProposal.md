# NeuroLog

## Application Definition Statement

We now know more than ever about how the human brain functions, as well as how and why it fails to function optimally. Perhaps the most important insight we’ve gleaned over the past several decades is that while all brains contain common features and functions, every brain is its own creature. And often, it’s a creature we ourselves don’t understand.

Often, we might find ourselves asking why we’re so tired all the time, or why our mood is sour. We might wonder why we’re having trouble focusing at work or resting at home. Searching for answers, we collect a litany of possibilities. But, without specific facts about our own personal situation to ground us, we can spend countless hours spinning our wheels and making frustratingly little progress. And, that's where NeuroLog comes in - helping us to discover these details and make sense of how to correct our lives.

NeuroLog would encourage the use of a variety of logging/journaling features, including long-form, short-form, and prompt-assisted entries. 

Long-form entries would be posted and securely stored for the user to later read, edit, or delete at their convenience. A handful of analysis functions would be performed on each entry to provide feedback concerning common topics and word choices, which could later be used by the user for insight into recurring thoughts or possible cognitive behavioral strategies. A single long-form entry a day could provide meaningful insight, although the app would support more entries as desired.

Short-form entries would be encouraged multiple times a day, and thus would be designed for ease - including graphical mood choices, and multiple-choice fields for energy level, degree of hunger and thirst, and other checklist items that may vary throughout the day. These logs would be further analyzed to form insightful charts related to average hour-by-hour energy levels, mood trends, and more. These collected short logs would also be accessible in daily collections for later review.

Prompt-assisted entries would be provided for the user to complete at their own pace, with the aim of provoking thought and expanding self-awareness. These posts, like the long-form posts, would be accessible for the user to look back on and read at any time. Sometimes a day may be uneventful, or a place to start writing may feel elusive. The prompt-assisted entries would create a starting point for the user to work from.

All logs would fill a viewable feed on the user’s activity feed, separated by day. And, the charts and collected data from the app’s analysis functions would be accessible on a separate page for personal metrics. The idea is not to create an app that can diagnose, treat, or cure - but to create an app that can provide a starting point for these diagnostic, treatment, and curative actions. Individuals, as well as their physicians and medical health professionals, are the only ones with the ability to make lasting positive changes, and yet users and their health care professionals need to know key details to tailor their care case by case. NeuroLog could be a vital tool for assisting in the discovery of these key details.


## Target Market

According to the World Health Organization, between 2007 and 2017, there was a 13% rise in mental health conditions and substance abuse disorders; and around 20% of the world's children and adolescents had been diagnosed with a mental health disorder. This, combined with the fact that the global median mental health expenditure is less than 2% of governement budgets (1), means that there is both a rising need for mental health support as well as a stagnating response from those in positions of power. Leading to individuals seeking help and support from whatever source they can find.

Since the global coronavirus pandemic, the rates of these mental health issues have increased at an even higher rate. According to the National Institutes of Health, in a 2021 study of Americans alone, nearly half of all participants reported recent symptoms of anxiety and depression - and 10% felt their mental health needs were not being met.(2)

Unsurprisingly then, the research conducted by Grand View Research in 2022 shows the global market size of mental health applications was valued at 5.2 billion USD, with an estimated annual growth of 15.9% from 2023 to 2030.(3) With NeuroLog, we could be a major tool in the arsenal for those suffering through mental health crises - either a means for the affected to use their metrics to make changes on their own or to bring key insights to the table when collaborating with their doctors and mental health professionals.

The target market would be those who have been diagnosed with mental health disorders or who have otherwise experienced difficulty with anxiety, depression, mood disorders, or substance abuse disorders. These individuals may be aged teen and above, and belong to any sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation.

A potential secondary market would be the personal development market. While there may be some overlap with the mental health market, one does not inherently need to suffer from a notable mental health disorder in order to seek the means to improve themselves and seek greater life success. Again according to research conducted by Grand View Research, this time in 2021, the personal development market was valued at 41.81 billion USD - with an expected compound annual growth of 5.5% from 2022 to 2030.(4)

The overall design and functionality of NeuroLog could remain consistent for both applications of the app, as the overall purpose of NeuroLog is to provide personalized metrics and not to attempt to provide mental health therapy nor personal success tips. What the user does with the information and analysis provided is adaptable to their personal needs and goals.

## User Profile

Example User - Type 1

User 1 is a teen that suffers from anxiety and depression, but he comes from a family that frowns upon therapy or seeking the help of mental health professionals. He thinks his parents have similar problems as he does, but they don't acknowledge it and thus he doesn't have a wealth of knowledge related to what causes these mental health issues and what can be done about them. So, he decides to download NeuroLog and begins regularly answering the questions and prompts. There's no lingo or fancy language, just simple inquiries about what he's feeling and how his day is going.

After a week or two of using the app regularly, he begins to notice that his energy levels plummet in the late afternoon and his depressive symptoms start soon after. On the one day he slept in a little longer than usual, he experienced less depressive feelings and had more energy for longer throughout the day. He draws the connection - maybe he's not getting enough sleep at night, staying up late and getting up early for school. Maybe he should try getting to bed a little earlier?

Example User - Type 2

User 2 is an ambitious young adult with a lot of goals they want to achieve. Despite this, user 2 notices her enthusiasm and motivation arriving late in the day - and by the time it's there, she has only a few hours to get her work done before having to go to bed. Why can't she focus in the mornings? She wonders. And why is it so hard to get motivated to work before sunset? She wants to understand, so she downloads NeuroLog and starts using it on a regular basis. 

After a little while, she starts to draw a connection between her early morning mental fog and her repeatedly choosing not to have breakfast. She discovers that once she gets a meal into her, the fog begins to go away and her mental faculties start to come online. So, then why doesn't her meal at lunch give her even more energy? Why does she feel so unmotivated around that time? Well, NeuroLog indicates that her drop in energy and motivation comes in after her lunch break - where she has the habit of eating a big meal and aimlessly surfing the internet as she does so. Maybe the heavy meal is making her sluggish, and maybe she gets caught in the addictive habit of web surfing and by the time her food digests and she realizes the time has gone by, several hours have passed. What if she changed these habits up a little? Until now, she didn't realize the effect these casual choices might be having on her mind and body.

## Use Cases

Use Case 1 - Mental Health Support

This user is going through a difficult time in their life, experiencing negative mental health symptoms such as anxiety, depression, or mood instability. They want to feel better and they want to be able to gain some degree of control over their lives. The trouble is, they don't know why they feel the way they do and/or they don't know what to do about it. Often times, going through a mental health crisis comes with brain fog and difficulty thinking through issues objectively.

Daily, this user logs onto NeuroLog and writes a general post about their day. A few times a day, they check in and provide a few details about how they're feeling. At their own convenience, they answer prompts designed to expand their self-awareness and examine their lives honestly. By journaling, they not only find some cathartic relief in giving voice to their thoughts and feelings, but they also provide a sample of their mindspace for the app to analyze for reoccuring concerns and common threads. After a week, they may have a clearer picture of their daily rhythmes. When do they feel at their best? When do they feel at their worst? Are there common thoughts or activities that might influence these patterns?

Perhaps this user discovers that they feel more anxious at night time, and this anxiety peaks just before they lay down for bed. This could be an indication of fear related to sleep, which opens a door for the user to explore or for a mental health professional to explore with them.

Use Case 2 - Productivity Enhancement

This user wants to learn about how to get their brain and body working in their favor. They have things to do and goals to achieve, but they're running into problems getting their work done effectively. Through long-form posts, they share the events of their day and how much they were able to accomplish. A few times a day, they log their mood, energy levels, hunger levels, and more. At their own pace, they answer prompts to learn about themselves and the structure of their daily lives. After a bit of time, some key insights should become apparent to them. For instance, they may discover the time of day that they feel the most energized or when they do their best work. They might discover that they get consistently sluggish and tired midday, or that they struggle to clear their brain fog in the mornings.

This user might discover that their habit of skipping breakfast is coinciding with ineffectual mornings, or that their heavy lunch is putting them into a carb coma that's putting them to sleep instead of energizing them to do their best work. The data presents itself and this productive go-getter tries a healthy breakfast or a lighter lunch, helping to improve their energy and work efficiency.

## Problem Statement

As previously stated, the instance of mental health issues increased globally by 13% from 2007 to 2013 (1), and in 2021 about half of all Americans reported suffering recent mental health systems such as anxiety and depression - with 10% saying their mental health needs were not being met. (2) Despite this, a small percentage of government expenditure on average is spent on trying to support mental health systems - less than 2% according to WHO in 2017. (1) Users are grasping for whatever mental health support systems they can find, and as of 2022, the market share for mental health applications is 5.2 billion USD with an estimated 15.9% annual growth from 2023 to 2030. (3)

The target market is suffering through a mental health crisis that the governmental and medical systems are struggling to address. With the rising number of sufferers, not all individuals will come from a long history of therapeutic treatment and may not know what's happening to their psyche or how to find the answers mental health professionals will need to help them. That's where NeuroLog would find its utility.

## Pain Points

According to the CDC in 2021, more than 4 in 10 students felt persistently sad or hopeless and nearly one-third experienced poor mental health. (1) In 2022, according to the College Student Mental Health Report, 77% of students experienced moderate to serious psychological distress - with 35% diagnosed with anxiety and 27% with depression. (2) Mental Health America reports that, as of 2023, 54.7% of adults with mental illnesses were not being treated. (3) And according to research by the National Alliance on Mental Illness, over 160 million people live in a designated Mental Health Professional Shortage Area (4). 

Suffice it to say, a lot of people are suffering with mental illness and symptoms of mental illness and a large percentage are not getting professional care.

## Solution Statement

NeuroLog aims to be a companion tool for those either fighting the mental health battle alone or who may need help in communicating their needs and particular difficulties to the mental health professionals in their area. Many of our competitors take the broad-stroke approach of trying to address a wide range of issues and brush over the distinct differences in circumstance, personality, and biology of the user. This can leave the user still feeling unsure of what to do in their own personal situation, and perhaps even left in the dark about the nature of their own personal situation. NeuroLog aims to dig into the details and unveil personal metrics that can provide immediately relevant insight to the user about what they're going through, why they may be going through it, and what might be done to improve their situation.

## Competition

One example competitor is the mental health application called Finch. It is a companion tool that, like NeuroLog, allows for journaling, frequent check-ins, and even tests or prompt-assistant journal entries. Unlike NeuroLog, it does not analyze posted information or provide more than simple bar graphs related to activity or mood. Rather than comparing data to suggest causal relationships, it presents simple indications of activity or number of times completing a task. It is a very comforting app with plenty to enjoy, but it does not provide the kind of analysis NeuroLog would provide.

Another competitor is Waffle Journal, which is another enjoyable app that is more centered around families rather than individuals. It provides helpful calendar and planning utilities, journaling/posting options, and ways to communicate with others and go on a mental health journey together. This app is lovely, and it creates an inviting positive atmosphere - but it also fails to provide the kind of practical data that NeuroLog would return to its users. It's also more specifically oriented toward mental health whereas NeuroLog could be flexible enough to address those needs as well as the needs of a personal development target market.

## Key Features

One key feature of NeuroLog would be comparative data analysis. A user would post long-form, short-form, and prompt-assisted entries and NeuroLog would use this data to create insights such as common topics related to negative mood, amount of sleep versus level of energy, time of day and mental/bodily well-being - drawing possible connections to indicate causal relationships the user may want to investigate further. One of the hard parts of dealing with mental illness is understanding where the symptoms come from, what the trigger points might be, and what to do differently to make positive change. With this data analysis feature, NeuroLog could provide key insights for the user to better understand their situation and what actions they might take to address it.

Another key feature would be visual graphs to chart changes over time. These graphs could, for instance, demonstate the rise and fall of the user's mood throughout a single day - or the average of these changes over longer periods like weeks or months. Other variables could also be graphed this way, including hunger, energy levels, and motivation. With time, it would be easy to extract from these graphs a sense of one's personal rhythmes. When is the right time to wake up and go to bed? When will one's motivation to work be at its highest and lowest? How does the time of day correlate to mood changes? All of these can be used to arrange one's day for greater efficiency, and also to potentially recognize the causes of these daily fluctuations and make corrective measures to adjust them.

## Integrations

I intend to create and use my own API to generate quality journaling prompts for the user by a GET method, filtering already-completed prompts out of the returned results by use of unique identification codes for each prompt. When a user selects to answer a journal prompt, the app will send a GET request for a prompt and the result will be filtered according to the user's completed prompt history.
