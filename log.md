üì¢   Weekly Stand Up
Each week I will summarize my milestone activity and progress by writing a stand-up. A stand-up is meant to be a succinct update on how things are going. Use these prompts as a guide on what to write about:

‚öôÔ∏è Overview - What I worked on this past week
üåµ Challenges - What problems did I have & how I'm addressing them
üèÜ Accomplishments - What is something I "leveled up" on this week
üîÆ Next Steps - What I plan to prioritize and do next


Week 1
Replace this paragraph with your stand up for this week. Use the prompts above to summarize your most recent milestone activity and work.

Week 2
My next stand up will go here...

Week 3
This week I started out working on conducting some research regarding security topics, such as the OWASP top 10. I then worked on several components and pages for the application, including the Dasboard, the Login and Registration processes, the Logout functionality, and some of the Archive.

The biggest challenge this week was trying to troubleshoot the issues going on with the registration and login processes. When a user registers through Postman, they are able to login perfectly fine. But, when they register through the actual registration process on the app, it doesn't work - despite the account showing up the same in the database. I think it may be related to the headers Postman uses, but I'm not sure. More research and trial and error is underway to solve the problem.

I feel that I leveled up on my use of, and integration of, components. I also leveled up with CSS, beginning to make use of the CSS grid display for the first time (and liking it a lot).

I'm prioritizing the completion of the big pieces, like the Archive and Stats pages, and the Profile page. The smaller details are very important, but given that I have a week left to go for this month I think I'd prefer to start the next month focusing on the details rather than having to complete large pieces of the app in the final stretch.

Week 4
This week I spent much longer than I had hoped trying to fix the problems with the login/registration. It took me down a long rabbit hole of a solution that ended up causing more problems than it solved. In the end, I got it functioning. However, because of this extended adventure, I ended up not finishing all the functionality nor fixing all the bugs I had wanted to by this month's completion. 

The biggest challenge was easily the troubleshooting of the login/registration issue. In hindsight, I wish I had spent more time working on other features and then figured out the bug later on. I was in a position, however, where it seemed that I had to solve this bug first before working on anything else. After the fact, I realize I could have just did some hardcoding in the meantime to get around the issue. 

I feel that I leveled up in working with CSS to make good use of the grid system once again, but this time with the placeholders for the custom mood emojis that are a part of the log functionality. I also got some more experience in customizing scroll bars.

Going forward, I want to first set up the stats page and stat gathering process before anything else, as that's honestly a pretty integral feature for the app overall. After that, I have some bugs to figure out with getting logs and posts by the logged in user's username, without returning logs and entries by other users. Otherwise, I want to clean up my code and make each process a bit more streamlined and sensible.
