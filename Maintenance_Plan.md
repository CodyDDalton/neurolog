<h1 align="center">Neurolog's Ongoing Maintenance and Development Plan</h2>

By no means is Neurolog a completed project. Version 1 is the most basic first iteration of this application, and version 2 will be a large step up. Along with ongoing work to make Neurolog a better and more complete application over time, it is my intention to provide ongoing support for any issues that may arise as time goes by and usage increases.

<h2 align="center">Corrective Maintenance</h2>

There are already a few bugs existent in Neurolog, and there will be future bugs - no doubt - as the app expands to include more functionality and further-reaching support. In the event of a bug being discovered - by myself or by users of this app - the correct action for corrective action is to file an issue in the Github project repository. 

<p align="center">https://github.com/ePortfolios/neurolog</p>

The issue should have a descriptive title and a clear summary of the bug so that it can be easily reproduced by other users. Before filing an issue, check the other filed issues to ensure that it has not already been filed. From there, I will arrange the issues according to priority in the project overview, and will work toward fixing these issues one by one.

<h2 align="center">Preventative Maintenance</h2>

As time goes on, the many technologies and packages used to make Neurolog will change. This may mean that certain code will no longer work as intended, or that the packages themselves may become obsolete and without support. Therefore, it is important that I - and any staff at Neurolog - keep tabs on any upcoming changes that may affect Neurolog’s functionality. It would be a major disappointment for our users to attempt to log on for the day, only to find that something has changed and the app hasn’t been changed to accommodate it.

Therefore, Neurolog should be frequently used and tested to ensure that all involved packages and code still function as intended. In addition, the most integral packages and technologies should be monitored for update announcements and what these updates could affect once installed.

<h2 align="center">Perfective Maintenance</h2>

As stated, Neurolog is most-assuredly not a finished project. There are yet more features - and perfective work upon those features - to come. At the time of this writing, we are working toward Neurolog V2. This version will include several new features, including randomly generated journaling prompts, text-analysis tools, interactions with Astrid the Friendly Robot, and a Stats page used to display graphs and comparative analysis related to user entries and mood logs in order to suggest possible correlations and triggers.

Version 3 and onwards is yet a mystery that we will all hopefully work to flesh out together. First and foremost among version 3 priorities would be to create a full Neurolog website and a Neurolog mobile app for the major platforms - such as IOS and Android.

Neurolog is a tool meant to provide comfort and support for those working on their mental health. We want to create an app that suits the needs of the users, and to do that effectively means keeping an open ear and an open mind. We want to hear your ideas and suggestions.
